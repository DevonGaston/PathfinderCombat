WELCOME TO THE PATHFINDER COMBAT SIMULATER
This program is used to create characters/creatures based on the rules of the Pathfinder Tabletop RPG and have them fight each other to see who
would theoretically win in a fight.  This program only follows the scenario where all characters are fighting against one another
and attacking nonstop until only one character/creature remains.

To use this program, you must first click he "Create Character" button in the main menu.  This will lead you to another menu asking you
your preferred creation method.  At this point, you can only use the "Quick Create" button, which will lead you to a menu asking you what
pre-generated character you would like to create (at this point, you can only create a Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, or Living Dead).
Click the button with the character you would like to generate for use in battle.  You must have at least 2 characters created to
initiate battle.

After you have created your characters, click the "Return to Main Menu" button to go back to the main menu.  If you made a mistake in the
creation process, you may click the "Clear Queue" button and repeat the creation process.

When you are ready to initiate combat, click the "Battle" button.  The characters/creatures you generated will roll for initiative to determine
the order in which the characters/creatures act (highest goes first, lowest goes last).  You will be informed about the
statistics of the characters/creatures in the battle as well, including overall health and AC (Armor Class), along with whose turn it is in the
big scrolling text box while the character/creature selected to be attacked will be shown in a smaller textbox to the topright of the bigger
one.  You may change the target of the attack by pressing the "Select" button.

When you have selected the target you wish the current character/creature to attack, click the "Attack" button.  The program will randomly
generate the attack roll of the character.  If it hits, the character's weapons will be rolled and applied to the target; if it's a critical,
the damage will be multiplied by the weapon's multiplier. The battle will continue until only one character remains above 0 hit points.
You will be taken back to the main menu, where you will have to create characters again before initiating a battle again.
